# DepreX-Predicting-Depression-Risk-Factors-Using-ML

This project leverages machine learning to assess the likelihood of individuals experiencing depression by analyzing various factors such as lifestyle habits, academic or work pressures, and mental health history. The final model predicts a depression risk score and identifies the primary factors contributing to that risk. The project includes a simple web application for user data input and risk assessment, as well as visualizations that highlight key factors influencing depression predictions.
